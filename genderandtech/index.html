				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>
					My name is Austin Weale. I am a Junior studying mathmatics, but I also have a strong interest in the study of technology. I also work as a TA for the introductory CS classes at UW which is what brings my interest of the class. We often discuss how we need to better improve the education process, and a big topic of discussion is how gender comes into play in the computer science culture. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The platform that I chose to use is for this class is plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I have also been a TA for the intro webprogramming class so I know a lot about it, and I want an opportunity to gain more practice. I have a lot of experience in the coding aspect of web programming, but almost no experience in design. So I hope to learn more about making an aesthetically pleasing web page.

					<p>
						Dona Sarkar is currently an engineering manager at Microsoft, an author and fashion designer. She is also the Grace Hopper Industry Track Chair at Microsoft, and a sought-out speaker for technology and diversity events. She has more than 12 years working with technology to draw upon in her speeches and writing. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Dona's wants to hire the next generation of women and minorities into the technology careers. Through her writing and public speaking, she extends this message around the world. The goal here is to retain diverse talent in the technology industry to break the lack of diversity we see currently. 
					</p>
					<p>
						I choose to write about Dona Sarkar because she is a great example of a person who is working currently to move the technology field towards more diversity. Through her diverse interests, she is a powerful role model for women in computing, and anyone who wants to keep diverse talents while pursuing a career in technology. This is important because a lot of people are turned away from technology fields because of a fear of losing a balanced lifestyle. Dona, on the other hand, shows that one can balance their interests with a technology career. Through all of her work, she still keeps her Microsoft position, keeping her connected to the field. She takes the opportunity to talk to the next generation at Universities extending her influence effectively.

				<h2>Gender in Film</h2>
				<p>
					The reason gender and film is such an important subject is the social impact that films carry in a modern society. As with a lot of topics we discuss in this class, Films follow the cycle in which their content shapes how society views gender and this view is then reflected in the production of future films, allowing any gender bias to continue. 
				</p>
				<p>
					One big issue that I found interesting in this presentation is the lack of gender representation in the actual production of films. I have never thought too much about the representation behind the scenes, and it is interesting to see that even behind the scenes, the field is male dominated. Another interesting take-away I have from this presentation is the Bechdel test and the fact that the majority of popular films fail this test. I feel the test is great for bringing attention to the fact that, although there are a lot of women in movies, they are often not included as dynamic characters. Finally, I found it interesting to see how different gender representation is between the Sundance films and Hollywood productions. 
				</p>
				<p>
					There are a few things that I still wonder about this topic. I am curious whether or not the popularity of Sundance films is increasing at such a rate that it will eventually measure up to the popularity of big productions. Since gender representation is so much more balanced in these films, it would be a nice substitute for popular movies. Since animation has more women interested than live-action films, I would be interested to find out if the production of live-action films could find a way to operate more like the animation industry. If this could happen, then maybe this could draw more women to the field. 
				</p>

				<h2>Gender and Mobile Apps</h2>
				<p>
					As smart phones become the norm in our society, the prevalence of mobile apps in our lives continues to increase. These apps can range from entertainment to business purposes. With such a broad scope, mobile apps can become a part of many aspects of our life. We can see from this that, like movies and social media, apps are one of the big media platforms that shape our society. Since gender stereotypes are so engrained in society, these stereotypes show through the apps themselves, which is why gender and mobile apps becomes an important topic to consider. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I found the studies that were presented during the presentation to be most interesting, specifically the one regarding people’s reactions to gender specific designs (gender specific apps were rated poorly by both men and women in favor of gender neutral apps). Since people responded so much better to gender-neutral-designed apps, it is interesting why we see so many apps that integrate gender-stereotypical designs into their product. It is also interesting to see the ways in which these apps con support work-life balance with apps such as the mobile mothering apps. However, even these show gender stereotypes by being designed for women, implying that women would be the only users concerned with parenthood-related tasks. 
				</p>
				<p>
					There are some questions I still have about this topic. I am curious if there are any numbers on the gender percentages of mobile app developers. It would be interesting to see if both women and men contribute reinforcing these stereotypes through this platform.  Another thing I am interested to find out is which types of apps tend to be more gendered and which types tend to be more gender neutral. This would be interesting in order to find out what types of developers demonstrate more bias or less.

				<h2 id="nuclear">Reading Response: Nuclear Language</h2>
				
				<p>
					In Nuclear Language and How We Learned to Pat the Bomb, Carol Cohn explores her past experience as a student learning about the engineering behind atomic bombs. What stands out about this piece is that it explores not just the nuclear bomb itself, but has a specific focus on the people behind the scenes studying, and engineering these devastating devices. 
				</p>
				<p>
					There are some immediate links between this and other STEM fields since the Cohn is indeed describing an engineering field. But the more important link to be made here is how this comes back to relate to gender in technology. By being immersed in the environment with other people, their language, and their mannerisms, Cohn found herself slipping into those habits, speaking in the same way, and eventually she found that she could speak about the construction of these bombs without the reality of the words coming to mind. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Cohn describes “Part of the appeal was the thrill of being able to manipulate an arcane language, the power of entering the secret kingdom” (Cohn, 21). Here she speaks of how she entered these classes with negativity towards the field and the people within in it. But as she began to learn their ways and speak the way they do, this negativity was quickly overridden by her excitement to be a part of this exclusive community. In her case, Cohn feels that her field is an exclusive group as they are a group of smart individuals with their own language. One can draw parallels between this group and the technology field. Specifically, we can gain insight into how technology fields remain such male dominated fields. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Entering into the Tech industry has many similarities to what Cohn faced. Newly entered into a study full of smart people, with their own tech jargon can bring this same image of an exclusive club that Cohn discusses.  Cohn describes an excitement that masked her ability to see the real problems with her work, which could be linked to the new workers in the tech industry. They may have problems with the gender issues that surround tech, but the excitement of working in this new field can mask their ability to continue to pursue these issues. In the context of Cohn’s work, she describes “the activity of trying to out-reason nuclear strategists gets you thinking inside their rules, tacitly accepting their accepting the unspoken assumptions of their paradigms” (Cohn, 23). She describes that by way of working within a system, one will think more and more within the rules of the system. So by working within a historically gender biased industry, such as the tech industry, it would follow that one would begin to think more in terms of these gender biased assumptions. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Through this comparison, Cohn’s work can draw distinct parallels between her work in nuclear strategic analysis and the gender issues that emerged in the tech industry. Most importantly, that the act of working within a system while simultaneously fighting a system may not be an effort one can keep up. This can be a possible factor in the reason that the tech industry remains such a male dominated industry even in todays modern society.

				<h2 id ="abbate">Reading Response: Abbate Chapter 1 </h2>

				<p>
					In the first Chapter of her book, Recoding Gender, Abbate creates a solid ground for the rest of the book covering the history of computing. The tone of the chapter is mostly historical, but takes time to explain how these periods of history can help us learn about the relationship between gender and technology. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<img src="http://www.moorecommgroup.com/uploads/facebook-share-images/we-can-do-it.jpg" />
				</p>
				<p>
					Abbate discusses how Women were called to action during the Wartime labor shortage.  This led women to play a major role in the foundation in the fundamentals of computer science, a field that is today overwhelmingly male dominated. However even this choice can be linked to gender stereotypes. In the Wartime effort men were sent to war leaving their jobs behind. We can see that even the reasoning behind hiring women as early programmers was grounded in the idea that Women were not suited for war. 
				</p>

				</p>
				<p>
					Women were employed with jobs essential to the operation of Colossus which involved various mental and physical abilities (Abbate, 27). Despite this, their superiors still classified their work as sub-professional, implying that their work was fixed and required no broad knowledge (Abbate, 26). However, this arises from an existing gender bias within society at this time. Since the work was performed by women, the superiors automatically assumed the work was less important and difficult (Abbate, 29). 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<img src="http://www.roguescast.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/youmadethisImadethis.jpg" />
				</p>
				<p>
					The Gender assumptions of the time also slipped into the debut showcase of the ENIAC. Snyder and Jennings received no credit for their projectile program, while the machine itself received the most recognition; the machine hardware design, however, was covered in the media (Abbate, 37). This is another instance that the devaluing of women’s contribution was present since the male dominated hardware design was presented, while the women’s software contribution was not mentioned.

				</p>
				<p>
					Abbate Takes a look at early computing which allows us to see some of the reasons why it is important to consider gender in technology.  These early days in computer science show that gender played a role in why women first became programmers, what their status was on the job, and in how they were recognized for their contributions to the field. With so many links to gender in this early era of computer science, it becomes natural to think of these

				<h2 id="geek">Reading Reflection: Geek Mythology</h2>
				<p>

					In “Geek Mythology,” Margolis Fischer explores the Computer science program of Carnegie Mellon in order to learn more about the students within the program.  
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<img src="http://planetsave.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/looking-in-the-mirror.jpg" />
				</p>
				<p>
					Fischer makes the point that, although many students have a similar description of the ideal programmer, “a larger number of students (both male and female) say this image of the computer science student ‘is not me’” in the survey 69% of women responders had this opinion (Fischer, 67). The result is that these women look at themselves and do not see a programmer looking back.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<img src="http://exclusive.multibriefs.com/images/exclusive/1212gender.jpg" />
				</p>
				<p>
					It’s important to note that while female students felt they did not fit the image of programmer, some male students felt the same way: 32% of men responded this way (Fischer, 68). However while women already make up a small proportion of CS students, the addition of this feeling of being different from this “geek mythology” representation can bring women to erroneously link their gender to this difference. Meanwhile, males are already entering a male dominated field which leaves them with fewer differences to question. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<img src="http://www.ethicsandentrepreneurship.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/work-life-balance-multi.jpg" />
				</p>
				<p>
					A common issue amongst women Margolis and Fischer interview is that they do not want to sacrifice their life in favor of programming (Fischer, 70). In the quote, the student continually references men as the people she is competing against. She says that she does not want to sacrifice her life but she says there are “quite a few guys that do” (Fischer, 70). Here she frames the argument that men are willing to do this and are thus more devoted. This view does not address the fact that there can be other ways to be good at programming that don’t involve sacrificing life-balance.  
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<img src="http://mamchenkov.net/wordpress/wp-content/20040913-programmer.jpg" />
				</p>
				<p>
					Fischer also takes time to discuss the role of what it means to love programming. There is the popular assumption that in order to love programming one must be the kind of person whose life is centered on coding (Fischer, 74). However, it’s important to consider other ways to love programming. Centering life around coding shows single-mindedness, a trait that may be more encouraged to males. It is important to consider the other ways one can show interest in a subject.
